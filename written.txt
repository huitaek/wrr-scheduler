We have tried different combinations of weight and number of processes. The experiments we have run:
weight=10, n=10
weight=10, n=5000
weight=2000, n=5000
weight=2000, n=10
we noticed that when the weight is very large(weight=2000), the scheduler works very similar to FIFO. Whatever that is in the front of run queue takes a fair amount of CPU time.  So when we run different processes on the phone, it tends to not be able to give fast response.
when the weight is small(weight=10), 
when n is large (n=5000), our load balancing works pretty well and each run queue of processing core has almost the same amount of tasks.
